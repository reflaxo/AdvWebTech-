      recipe: "Kartoffelknödel figure in the cuisine of most regions of Germany and are a typical side dish with roasted and braised meats. This particular dumpling recipe, using both cooked and raw potatoes, comes from Bavaria. Potato dumplings are also popular in the Czech Republic, where they are known as bramborové knedlíky. ",
      /*4 to 6 servings
      
      INGREDIENTS
      Baking potatoes, peeled -- 2 pounds
      Breadcrumbs (optional.) -- 1/4 cup
      Salt and pepper -- to taste
      Nutmeg -- 1/4 teaspoon
      Egg (optional), beaten -- 1
      Croutons -- 6 to 8
      METHOD
      Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add half the potatoes. Boil until the potatoes are cooked through and tender, then drain, cool and put through a ricer or mash until smooth.
      Using the fine holes of a grater or food processor attachment, grate the remaining potatoes and place in a a large bowl of water with a little vinegar added (this keeps the potatoes white).
      When all of the potatoes are grated, remove them from the water — saving the water — and place them in a colander. Squeeze them until they are very dry. Or you can place the grated potatoes in a clean dishtowel, wrap them tightly and twist the towel to remove any excess moisture.
      Carefully, drain the excess water from the potato soaking water, retaining the potato starch that should have settled to the bottom of the bowl.
      Mix the potato starch into the riced or mashed potatoes, along with the grated potatoes, breadcrumbs, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Mix in the egg if using.
      Using wetted hands, take about 3/4 cup of potato mixture and form it into a rough ball. Press a crouton into the middle and smooth out the ball. Repeat with the remaining potato mixture.
      Bring a large pot of salted water to a simmer. Drop the dumplings carefully into the simmering water and cook for 15 to 20 minutes. Do not boil or the dumplings could fall apart. Drain and serve hot.
      KARTOFFELKNÖDEL VARIATIONS
      If the potato mixture seems too wet and sticky, knead in some potato starch, cornstarch or flour, a tablespoon or so at a time, until the mixture holds together.
      Fill each dumpling with a piece of ham or a big pinch of sauerkraut instead of the croutons if you like.
      Mix some chopped parsley into the dumpling mixture."*/
